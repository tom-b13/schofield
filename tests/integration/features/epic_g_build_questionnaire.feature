Feature: Epic G â€” Build questionnaire (authoring)
  As an author
  I want to create and organise screens and questions
  So that questionnaires can be assembled deterministically with safe ordering and visibility rules

  Background:
    Given a questionnaire "Q-100" exists
    And no screens exist for questionnaire "Q-100"
    And I use base path "/api/v1/authoring"
    And I clear captured ETags and idempotency keys

  @happy_path
  Scenario: Create screen without proposed position assigns order 1
    When I POST "/questionnaires/Q-100/screens" with body:
      | title | Getting started |
    And I set header "Idempotency-Key" to "idem-s-001"
    Then the response status should be 201
    And the response should include a "screen_id"
    And the response body "title" should equal "Getting started"
    And the response body "screen_order" should equal 1
    And the response should include headers "Screen-ETag" and "Questionnaire-ETag"

  @happy_path
  Scenario: Create second screen with proposed position reindexes contiguously
    Given screen "S-1" exists on questionnaire "Q-100" with title "Getting started" and order 1
    When I POST "/questionnaires/Q-100/screens" with body:
      | title             | Basics |
      | proposed_position | 1      |
    And I set header "Idempotency-Key" to "idem-s-002"
    Then the response status should be 201
    And the response body "title" should equal "Basics"
    And the response body "screen_order" should equal 1
    And screen "S-1" now has "screen_order" 2
    And the response should include headers "Screen-ETag" and "Questionnaire-ETag"

  @happy_path
  Scenario: Rename a screen and keep position (If-Match required)
    Given screen "S-2" exists on questionnaire "Q-100" with title "Basics" and order 1
    And I have the current "Screen-ETag" for "S-2"
    When I PATCH "/questionnaires/Q-100/screens/S-2" with body:
      | title | Introduction |
    And I set header "If-Match" to the current "Screen-ETag" for "S-2"
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the response body "screen_id" should equal "S-2"
    And the response body "title" should equal "Introduction"
    And the response should include headers "Screen-ETag" and "Questionnaire-ETag"

  @happy_path
  Scenario: Create question scaffold without answer_kind (unset) and assigned order

    When I POST "/questionnaires/Q-100/questions" with body:
      | screen_id     | S-2              |
      | question_text | What is your HQ? |
    And I set header "Idempotency-Key" to "idem-q-001"
    Then the response status should be 201
    And the response should include a "question_id"
    And the response body "screen_id" should equal "S-2"
    And the response body "question_text" should equal "What is your HQ?"
    And the response body "answer_kind" should be absent or null
    And the response body "question_order" should equal 1
    And the response should include headers "Question-ETag", "Screen-ETag" and "Questionnaire-ETag"

  @happy_path
  Scenario: Update question text with If-Match
    Given question "Q-1" exists on screen "S-2" with text "What is your HQ?" and order 1
    And I have the current "Question-ETag" for "Q-1"

      | question_text | Where is your HQ located? |
    And I set header "If-Match" to the current "Question-ETag" for "Q-1"
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the response body "question_id" should equal "Q-1"
    And the response body "question_text" should equal "Where is your HQ located?"
