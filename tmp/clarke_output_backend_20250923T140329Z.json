Specifically: (1) Remove the blanket prohibition on constraints/index DDL in the first migration and instead assert that at least one CREATE TABLE statement appears before any ALTER TABLE/CREATE INDEX statements in the first applied SQL; (2) In the Given step, validate each migration filename against the MigrationFile subschema from 'schemas/erd_and_runtime_inputs.schema.json' and fail clearly on validation errors (do not 'pass' in the except). Also add an assertion that the first journal entry filename is 'migrations/001_init.sql' to align with ordering.",

Current step enforces 'forbidden_first' tokens (ALTER TABLE/CREATE UNIQUE INDEX/CREATE INDEX) in Then (tests/integration/features/steps/epic_a_behaviour_steps.py ~lines 135–153). Repo migration 'migrations/001_init.sql' includes ALTER TABLE and CREATE INDEX statements, so the prohibition exceeds the scenario. Additionally, Given swallows JSON Schema errors with 'except Exception: pass' when validating MigrationFile (same file ~lines 108–121), violating fail-fast guidance in AGENTS.md."
