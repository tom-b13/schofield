# epic name

etag optimistic concurrency control (epic k, phase 0)

# intent

Centralise how etags are enforced and emitted so the front end can read a single, predictable set of headers and stop special‑casing. Phase 0 is non‑destructive: no token value changes, no status‑code changes, no new body fields.

# glossary

- etag: opaque version token for a resource
- if-match: precondition header that must match the current etag to allow a write
- domain header: a resource‑specific etag header alias, e.g. Screen-ETag, Question-ETag, Questionnaire-ETag, Document-ETag

# actors

- end user in the authoring ui (screens/questions)
- end user in the runtime ui (answers/screens)
- http clients consuming document or csv endpoints (downloads)

# guiding principles

- do not change token algorithms or values in phase 0
- enforce preconditions early on routes that already do so today (answers/documents); preserve existing status codes and problem shapes; do not add enforcement to authoring routes in phase 0
- emit domain headers on all in-scope responses; emit ETag alongside the domain header only on routes that already return ETag (runtime/answers/documents). Do not add ETag to authoring routes in phase 0
- keep existing body mirrors as‑is (e.g. screen_view.etag); do not add outputs.etags
- on successful mutation, always echo fresh tags

### Append to guiding principles — Post‑Review Additions (Phase‑0)
- Mount a **central precondition guard** on all in‑scope **write** routes (answers/documents) via dependency injection; **do not** mount on authoring or read (GET) routes.
- Keep handlers **free of inline If‑Match logic**. Parsing/normalisation/comparison and problem responses belong **only** in the guard.
- The guard must be **DB‑free**: do not import or touch repositories/DB drivers (e.g., psycopg2); call only public `app.logic.etag` helpers and import them **inside** guard functions.
- Declare `If-Match` as a **required header parameter** on in‑scope write routes for contract visibility (enforcement remains in the guard).
- UI/event sequencing is **out of scope** for Epic K; no requirements on event order are introduced here.

# contract overview

read responses

- runtime JSON resources (answers/screens/documents): include both ETag and the domain header with the same legacy value
- authoring JSON resources (Epic G): include domain header(s) only (no generic ETag added in phase 0)
- screens continue to include screen_view.etag in the body (unchanged)
- csv or other non‑json downloads: include both ETag and the domain header where feasible; bodies are unchanged

write requests (patch/post/delete)

- if-match is normalised and checked before mutation
- on mismatch, return the route’s existing status code and problem shape (unchanged)
- on success, return domain header(s) with the fresh legacy value. Also return ETag where the route already returns it today (runtime/answers/documents). Do not add generic ETag to authoring routes in phase 0; bodies remain unchanged except where they already include an etag field

### Append to contract overview — Post‑Review Additions (Phase‑0)
- **Problem+json mapping (unchanged shapes):**
  - Missing `If-Match` → **428 Precondition Required**, `code=PRE_IF_MATCH_MISSING`.
  - Mismatched `If-Match` → existing route status (**409** or **412**) with `code=PRE_IF_MATCH_ETAG_MISMATCH`.
- On **document reorder** precondition failures, emit diagnostic headers **`X-List-ETag`** and, when applicable, **`X-If-Match-Normalized`** alongside the problem body.

# per‑resource behaviour

screens

- get: set Screen-ETag and ETag to the same legacy value; ensure screen_view.etag remains populated
- patch/post/delete: enforce if-match early; keep current conflict status; on success, set both headers with the fresh value
- authoring screen routes (Epic G): domain headers only; do not introduce generic ETag in phase 0

answers

- patch/post/delete: enforce if-match early; return 409 on mismatch and 428 when missing If-Match; on success, set Screen-ETag and ETag with the fresh value

questions

- phase 0: no change (headers as currently emitted); the front end reads `Question-ETag` if present, else `ETag`

documents

- get and any write endpoints that already exist: keep current behaviour and status codes; additionally emit Document-ETag alongside ETag; no body mirror added
- preserve diagnostic headers already emitted by reorder (e.g., X-List-ETag and X-If-Match-Normalized) during Phase 0

questionnaires (csv export)

- get csv: keep legacy ETag behaviour; additionally emit Questionnaire-ETag with the same legacy value
- header names are case-insensitive; some clients (e.g., fetch) lowercase to `questionnaire-etag`

placeholders

- post /placeholders/bind and /placeholders/unbind: preserve current 412 behaviour on mismatch and include ETag header in the response as today; no additional domain headers in phase 0
- get /questions/{id}/placeholders: preserve existing body "etag" field and set ETag header to the same value

response sets

- no change in phase 0

### Append to per‑resource behaviour — Post‑Review Additions (Phase‑0)
- **Guard scope**: apply guard to **answers** and **documents** writes only; **exclude** authoring and all **GET** endpoints.
- **Documents reorder failures**: must include **`X-List-ETag`** and **`X-If-Match-Normalized`** where normalisation occurred.

# request handling pipeline (phase 0)

1. normalise if-match

   - preserve "*" semantics: treat "*" as unconditional write (resource-exists precondition) where routes already accept it; do not change route status codes.
   - support comma-separated lists: split on commas outside quotes; match succeeds if ANY tag matches the current token.
   - accept weak/strong forms: treat W/"abc" and "abc" as equivalent in phase 0.
   - quote handling: strip surrounding quotes, unescape " inside, and trim whitespace.
   - case handling: compare token bytes case-sensitively; ignore case only for the W/ prefix.
   - multiple headers: join multiple If-Match header instances with "," before parsing.
   - empty/invalid tokens: ignore invalid entries; if nothing valid remains, treat as mismatch (preserve each route’s existing status on mismatch).
   - parity basis: compare against the current legacy token normalised with the same rules; do not alter the stored/emitted value.
   - note: comma-separated If-Match support is provided by the normaliser for forward-compatibility; current endpoints do not require it.

2. precondition enforcement

   - perform the check before mutation
   - on mismatch: return the existing status code and problem body used by the route

3. mutation and tag retrieval

   - perform the mutation as today
   - retrieve the current legacy tag value using the existing algorithm

4. header emission

   - set ETag to the legacy value
   - set the domain header (Screen-ETag, Question-ETag, Questionnaire-ETag, Document-ETag) to the same value (placeholders: ETag only in phase 0)

5. body mirrors

   - do not add new mirrors; continue to include screen_view.etag where it already exists

### Append to request handling pipeline — Post‑Review Additions (Phase‑0)
- **Guard placement**: steps **1–2** execute inside `precondition_guard`; handlers must enter at step **3** only after guard success.
- **DB isolation**: the guard must not import DB drivers or repositories; it must rely solely on public ETag helpers, imported **inside** the guard function scope.
- **Diagnostics on failure** (documents reorder): on step **2** failure, emit **`X-List-ETag`** and optional **`X-If-Match-Normalized`**.

# caching and conditional gets

- no behavioural change mandated in phase 0
- endpoints may accept If-None-Match as they do today; validators and 304s remain as currently implemented

# logging and observability

- log an etag.enforce event when preconditions are checked, including route name and a redacted indicator of match/mismatch (not the raw token); log only `matched: true|false` and a route id; never log token substrings
- log an etag.emit event when headers are written, including route name and domain header used

### Append to logging and observability — Post‑Review Additions (Phase‑0)
- Emit minimal telemetry for guard outcomes: `etag.enforce` (pre‑mutation), `etag.emit` (post‑success headers). No UI/event sequencing logs are required by this epic.

# openapi updates (non‑breaking)

- annotate affected endpoints to declare the additional domain headers in 2xx and error responses where applicable
- ensure `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` exposes the added domain headers (Screen-ETag, Question-ETag, Document-ETag, Questionnaire-ETag)
- bodies remain unchanged

### Append to openapi updates — Post‑Review Additions (Phase‑0)
- Declare `If-Match` as a **required header parameter** on in‑scope write routes (visibility only; enforcement remains in the guard).
- Document error responses for **428** and **409/412** with invariant problem shapes and codes (`PRE_IF_MATCH_MISSING`, `PRE_IF_MATCH_ETAG_MISMATCH`).

# compatibility constraints

- legacy token values must not change in phase 0
  - tests: capture a baseline tag from the current build; after refactor, the same request must return **exactly the same** header token string (including `W/` prefix and quotes). No whitespace/quoting/strength changes.
- existing status codes and problem bodies must not change (e.g., answers: 409 on mismatch; 428 when missing; documents: 412 on mismatch)
  - tests: trigger each route’s mismatch/missing-precondition and assert the same status. Assert problem JSON has identical keys/shape and invariant error codes/messages; no additional/renamed fields.
- authoring routes must not add If-Match enforcement in phase 0; keep current success flows (tests assume success without precondition checks)
  - tests: authoring writes should succeed without asserting If-Match; adding enforcement would fail existing features.
- no new body fields are introduced; preserve existing body mirrors (e.g., `screen_view.etag`, placeholders `etag`)
  - tests: assert `outputs.etags` is **absent**. For screens, assert `screen_view.etag` exists and equals the domain header value. For placeholders, assert body `etag` exists and equals response `ETag`.
- csv and other binary formats remain unchanged aside from additional response headers
  - tests: assert `Content-Type` unchanged; payload bytes equal baseline (or checksum match). Assert presence of `Questionnaire-ETag` and/or `ETag`; no wrapper/format changes.
- preserve existing diagnostic headers on document reorder (X-List-ETag, X-If-Match-Normalized)
  - tests: assert both headers are present and non-empty; values follow the same legacy format/rules as before; no rename or removal.

### Append to compatibility constraints — Post‑Review Additions (Phase‑0)
- **Handler isolation**: confirm handlers contain **no** If‑Match parsing/validation or precondition problem construction.
- **Guard isolation**: confirm guard contains **no** imports of private ETag internals and **no** DB/repository imports at module scope; any allowed helper imports occur inside the guard function.
- **CORS**: confirm `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` includes all domain headers in both success and error responses for in‑scope routes.

1. Scope
1.1 Purpose

Establish a uniform, non-destructive ETag contract so clients can rely on consistent request preconditions and response headers across resources, reducing UI complexity and test flakiness in Phase 0.

1.2 Inclusions

Centralised normalisation of If-Match for routes that already enforce preconditions (answers, documents).

Consistent header exposure: emit domain ETag headers (Screen-/Question-/Questionnaire-/Document-ETag) on in-scope responses; also emit generic ETag only where it exists today (runtime/answers/documents).

Preserve existing body mirrors where present (e.g., screen_view.etag); ensure successful writes echo fresh tags in headers.

Per resource behaviour: runtime JSON returns domain header + ETag; authoring JSON returns domain header only; CSV/binary returns domain header (and existing ETag) without changing payloads.

Non-breaking documentation/ops updates: declare headers in OpenAPI and expose them via CORS so browsers can read them.

Lightweight observability: log precondition checks and header emission events (redacted).

1.3 Exclusions

No changes to token algorithms/values, response bodies, or status codes/problem shapes.

No new body fields (e.g., no outputs.etags) and no database/schema changes.

No addition of If-Match enforcement to authoring routes in Phase 0.

No caching/idempotency redesign or front-end UI rewrites.

1.4 Context

This story is part of Epic K (Phase 0) and underpins Epic H’s frontend shim by providing a stable concurrency and header contract. It aligns with Epic G authoring flows without altering their success paths. The work touches server HTTP interfaces only, interacting with existing REST endpoints and standard HTTP semantics (ETag/If-Match) plus CORS for header exposure.

## 2.2.2 Event-driven requirements

* **E1** When a write request with If-Match is received on answers routes, the system will check the precondition before performing any mutation.
* **E2** When a write request with If-Match is received on document routes, the system will check the precondition before performing any mutation.
* **E3** When a write operation completes successfully, the system will emit updated domain ETag header(s) in the response.
* **E4** When a runtime JSON GET is processed, the system will include both the domain ETag header and the generic ETag header with the same value.
* **E5** When an authoring JSON GET is processed, the system will include domain ETag header(s) only.
* **E6** When exporting questionnaire CSV, the system will include Questionnaire-ETag in the response without changing the payload.
* **E7** When returning a screen GET, the system will include screen_view.etag in the body.
* **E8** When If-Match is missing on an in-scope write route, the system will return 428 Precondition Required with problem code PRE_IF_MATCH_MISSING.
* **E9** When If-Match does not match on an in-scope write route, the system will return the route’s existing conflict status (409 or 412) with problem code PRE_IF_MATCH_ETAG_MISMATCH.

## 2.2.3 State-driven requirements

* **S1** While authoring routes are in Phase 0, the system will not enforce If-Match preconditions.
* **S2** While processing placeholders endpoints in Phase 0, the system will emit only the generic ETag header in responses.
* **S3** While If-None-Match validators are supported on an endpoint, the system will maintain the current 304 behaviour unchanged.
* **S4** While processing read (GET) endpoints, the system will bypass the precondition guard.

## 2.2.4 Optional-feature requirements

* **O1** Where wildcard If-Match "*" is accepted by a route, the system will treat it as a resource-exists precondition.
* **O2** Where multiple resource scopes are affected by a mutation, the system will emit domain ETag headers for each affected scope present in the response.
* **O3** Where both a domain ETag header and a body mirror are present for screens, the system will treat the header value as authoritative.
* **O4** Where document reorder diagnostics are supported, the system will include existing diagnostic headers unchanged in corresponding responses.
* **O5** Where token normalisation occurs on document reorder failures, the system will include X-If-Match-Normalized alongside diagnostic headers.

## 2.2.5 Unwanted-behaviour requirements

* **N1** If all provided If-Match tokens are invalid after normalisation, the system will treat the request as a precondition mismatch.
* **N2** If a non-matching If-Match token is supplied on answers routes, the system will respond 409 without mutating state.
* **N3** If a non-matching If-Match token is supplied on document routes, the system will respond 412 without mutating state.
* **N4** If If-Match is missing on answers routes, the system will respond 428 without mutating state.
* **N5** If both a domain ETag header and a generic ETag header are present and differ, the system will prefer the domain header value when exposing tags.
* **N6** If header and body ETag values for a screen differ, the system will prefer the header value without failing the request.
* **N7** If a document reorder precondition fails, the system will include X-List-ETag and X-If-Match-Normalized in the response.
* **N8** If If-Match is missing on document write routes, the system will respond 428 without mutating state.
* **N9** If a precondition failure response is returned, the system will include a stable problem code of PRE_IF_MATCH_MISSING or PRE_IF_MATCH_ETAG_MISMATCH.

# 6.1 Architectural Acceptance Criteria

**6.1.1 Shared If-Match normaliser**
A single reusable normalisation utility is defined and is the only mechanism used to parse/normalise `If-Match` across in-scope routes.
**Refs:** STEP-1; U1, U2, U3, U4, U5, U6, U7

**6.1.2 Precondition guard as a discrete unit**
The precondition enforcement is implemented as a discrete middleware/guard component that is separate from mutation handlers.
**Refs:** STEP-2; E1, E2

**6.1.3 Guard mounted on write routes only (answers/documents)**
The precondition guard is mounted on answers and document write endpoints and is invoked before any mutation handler.
**Refs:** STEP-2; E1, E2

**6.1.4 Guard not mounted on authoring routes (Phase-0)**
No authoring route registers or invokes the precondition guard in Phase-0.
**Refs:** STEP-2; S1

**6.1.5 Central header-emission utility**
A single response-header emitter is used by all in-scope responses to set domain ETag headers and (where applicable) the generic `ETag`.
**Refs:** STEP-4; U9, U10, U11; E3, E4, E5, E6

**6.1.6 Scope→header mapping centralised**
The mapping from resource scope to domain header name (Screen-ETag, Question-ETag, Questionnaire-ETag, Document-ETag) is declared once and reused by the header-emission utility.
**Refs:** STEP-4; U16

**6.1.7 CORS exposes required ETag headers**
The CORS configuration explicitly exposes all domain ETag headers (and `ETag`) required for browser access.
**Refs:** STEP-4; U13

**6.1.8 Outputs schema declares canonical keys**
The canonical outputs schema declares the required top-level keys `headers` and `body` exactly as specified.
**Refs:** outputs; outputs.headers; outputs.body

**6.1.9 Outputs schema includes domain header fields**
The canonical outputs schema includes fields for `Screen-ETag`, `Question-ETag`, `Questionnaire-ETag`, `Document-ETag`, and `ETag` under `headers`.
**Refs:** outputs.headers.Screen-ETag; outputs.headers.Question-ETag; outputs.headers.Questionnaire-ETag; outputs.headers.Document-ETag; outputs.headers.ETag

**6.1.10 No new body mirrors introduced**
No additional body mirrors (e.g., no `outputs.etags`) are declared in schemas or response assemblers beyond those already specified.
**Refs:** STEP-5; U12

**6.1.11 Screen body mirror retained**
Where `screen_view` is returned, the schema and response assembly retain `screen_view.etag` exactly as specified.
**Refs:** STEP-5; E7; outputs.body.screen_view.etag

**6.1.12 Diagnostic headers preserved for reorder**
The emission path preserves support for `X-List-ETag` and `X-If-Match-Normalized` on document reorder responses.
**Refs:** STEP-4; O4

**6.1.13 Token computation isolated and unchanged**
The tag retrieval/compute mechanism is isolated from normalisation/enforcement code and remains unmodified in Phase-0.
**Refs:** STEP-3; U17, U8

**6.1.14 OpenAPI responses declare domain headers**
Affected endpoint responses in the API specification declare the relevant domain ETag headers (and `ETag` where applicable).
**Refs:** STEP-4; E3, E4, E5, E6

**6.1.15 CSV/non-JSON emission uses same header utility**
The header-emission utility is usable from non-JSON response paths (e.g., CSV export) to set `Questionnaire-ETag` (and `ETag` where applicable).
**Refs:** STEP-4; E6

**6.1.16 Logging interface defines etag event types**
A logging interface declares the two event types `etag.enforce` and `etag.emit` for use at precondition check and header emission points.
**Refs:** STEP-2, STEP-4; U14, U15

6.1.17 Guard not mounted on any GET/read endpoints
The precondition guard must be excluded from all GET/read routes across resources (runtime and authoring).
Refs: STEP-2; S4

6.1.18 Guard is DB-free and import-safe
The guard module must import no repositories or DB drivers at module scope; importing the guard must succeed with no DB driver installed. Any allowed ETag helper imports occur lazily inside guard functions.
Refs: STEP-2; U19

6.1.19 Handlers contain no inline precondition logic
Mutation handlers must not parse/normalise/compare If-Match, nor construct precondition problem responses; those concerns live only in the guard.
Refs: STEP-2; U18

6.1.20 Stable problem+json mapping for preconditions
The guard centralises error mapping: missing If-Match → 428 with code PRE_IF_MATCH_MISSING; mismatched If-Match → existing route status (409 or 412) with code PRE_IF_MATCH_ETAG_MISMATCH. Shapes remain invariant.
Refs: STEP-2; E8, E9

6.1.21 OpenAPI declares If-Match as a required request header on write routes
All in-scope write endpoints declare If-Match as a required header parameter (e.g., FastAPI Header(..., alias="If-Match", convert_underscores=False)), with enforcement still in the guard.
Refs: OpenAPI; STEP-2

6.1.22 Guard uses only public ETag APIs
The guard may only call documented, public app.logic.etag helpers; no private/import-path internals are allowed.
Refs: STEP-1, STEP-2; U19

6.1.23 Diagnostic headers emitted via the central emitter
On document reorder precondition failures, X-List-ETag and (when applicable) X-If-Match-Normalized are attached by the shared header-emission/diagnostics utility, not handcrafted in handlers.
Refs: STEP-4; O4; N7

6.1.24 CORS request header allow-list includes If-Match
CORS configuration must allow the If-Match request header so browsers can send it on writes (e.g., Access-Control-Allow-Headers: If-Match).
Refs: STEP-2; E1, E2

6.1.25 Guard responses participate in CORS
Early guard failures (e.g., 428/409/412) must still include the CORS headers configured for the API so browsers can read diagnostic headers and problem bodies.
Refs: STEP-2; U13

6.1.26 No repository calls before guard success
Route pipelines must be ordered such that repository/DB access occurs only after guard success (short-circuit on failure).
Refs: STEP-2; U18, U19

## 6.3.2.1
**Title:** CORS expose-headers misconfiguration blocks ETag visibility  
**Criterion:** Given a response ready for header emission (STEP-4 Header emission), when the CORS Access-Control-Expose-Headers configuration omits required ETag headers, then halt STEP-4 Header emission and stop propagation to response finalisation for client-visible meta headers, as required by the error mode’s Flow Impact.  
**Error Mode:** ENV_CORS_EXPOSE_HEADERS_MISCONFIGURED  
**Reference:** Dependency: CORS/expose headers; Steps: STEP-4

6.3.2.2

Title: Logging sink unavailable during precondition check does not affect flow
Criterion: Given STEP-2 Precondition enforcement attempts to record an etag.enforce event, when the logging sink is unavailable, then the system proceeds without altering the response, mutation, or headers; only telemetry is degraded, as required by the error mode’s Flow Impact.
Error Mode: ENV_LOGGING_SINK_UNAVAILABLE_ENFORCE
Reference: Dependency: logging sink; Steps: STEP-2; EARS: U14

6.3.2.3

Title: Logging sink unavailable during header emission does not affect flow
Criterion: Given STEP-4 Header emission attempts to record an etag.emit event, when the logging sink is unavailable, then the system proceeds to finalisation with headers intact; only telemetry is degraded, as required by the error mode’s Flow Impact.
Error Mode: ENV_LOGGING_SINK_UNAVAILABLE_EMIT
Reference: Dependency: logging sink; Steps: STEP-4; EARS: U15

6.3.2.4

Title: Upstream proxy strips domain ETag headers (egress)
Criterion: Given STEP-4 Header emission has assembled domain ETag headers (and ETag where applicable), when the deployment environment or gateway policy is detected to strip those headers, then block finalisation for the response and surface an operational error per the error mode’s Flow Impact.
Error Mode: ENV_PROXY_STRIPS_DOMAIN_ETAG_HEADERS

Title: CORS allow-headers does not permit If-Match on preflight
Criterion: Given an OPTIONS CORS preflight to an in-scope write endpoint (answers/documents), when Access-Control-Allow-Headers does not include If-Match, then treat the write as blocked for browser clients and halt the pipeline before STEP-2 (no guard, no mutation), as required by the error mode’s Flow Impact.
Error Mode: ENV_CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS_MISSING_IF_MATCH
Reference: Dependency: CORS/allow headers; Steps: STEP-2; EARS: E1, E2

6.3.2.6

Title: Upstream proxy strips If-Match (ingress)
Criterion: Given a write request sent with If-Match, when an upstream proxy removes or renames the header so the application receives no If-Match, then the guard responds with the contractually defined missing-precondition error (e.g., 428 with PRE_IF_MATCH_MISSING), no mutation occurs, and the pipeline halts at STEP-2, per the error mode’s Flow Impact.
Error Mode: ENV_PROXY_STRIPS_IF_MATCH
Reference: Dependency: API gateway/proxy ingress policy; Steps: STEP-2; EARS: E1, E2, U18

6.3.2.7

Title: Guard misapplied to read endpoints (Phase-0 scope breach)
Criterion: Given any GET/read endpoint during Phase-0, when the precondition guard is invoked (e.g., attempts to enforce If-Match), then treat this as a configuration error: halt the pipeline with a server error and do not emit domain or generic ETag headers, as required by the error mode’s Flow Impact.

7.2.1.13 CORS exposes domain headers on authoring reads

Purpose: Verify an authoring JSON GET exposes its domain header(s) via CORS in Access-Control-Expose-Headers (no generic ETag).
Test data: GET /api/v1/authoring/screens/welcome (Epic G path), no special headers.
Mocking: None — exercise the live authoring endpoint.
Assertions:

Status is 200.

Header Screen-ETag (or Question-ETag, depending on resource) exists and is a non-empty string.

Header ETag is absent.

Header Access-Control-Expose-Headers exists and (case-insensitively) includes the emitted domain header name (e.g., contains screen-etag when Screen-ETag is present).

Method: OPTIONS

Headers:

Origin: https://app.example.test

Access-Control-Request-Method: PATCH

Access-Control-Request-Headers: If-Match, Content-Type
Mocking: None — send a real preflight request.
Assertions:

Status is 204 (or the route’s preflight success status).

Header Access-Control-Allow-Methods includes PATCH.

Header Access-Control-Allow-Headers (case-insensitive parsing) includes if-match and content-type.

(Negative control in same test): preflight to an authoring GET route should still succeed but need not include if-match.
